DICEE GAME

This HTML file sets up a basic layout for a Dicee game, where two players can roll dice to see who wins. 
To make the game functional, we need to add CSS for styling and JavaScript to handle the dice roll logic.

HTML Structure
The HTML creates a container with two dice, each represented by an image. Initially, both images show a six-sided die.

CSS (styles.css)
Create a styles.css file to style the game elements.

JavaScript (index.js)
Create an index.js file to handle the game logic.

HTML: Sets up the structure for the Dicee game.
CSS: Styles the game elements for a visually appealing design.
JavaScript: Implements the logic for rolling dice and determining the winner. 
The dice roll occurs when the page is refreshed, displaying random dice images and the game result in the <h1> element.
